# Patient Groups

A patient group is a simply a grouping of patients that one can use to identify patients.  It is useful in two cases:

 1. You wish to identify a group of patients that don't have any other shared properties - for example, a church youth group or a wait list of hernias.
 2. You wish to provide special pricing rules to a patient.

The first scenario is straightforward.  If you put patients in a group, you can later look them up based on that group.  The list of patients in a group can be filtered from the patient registry or linked directly from the patient groups management page.

The second scenario requires more management.  A patient group can have a particular price list, invoicing fees, and subsidies applied to it.  Any patients in this group will also benefit from these special pricing arrangements.  For example, if you wish to say that all children get reduced prices, you might make a group for children and put any new child patient in it.  When the child passes to adulthood, they are removed.  This group would have special pricing applied to it.
